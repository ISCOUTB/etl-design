"""Model schemas module.

This module contains Pydantic models that correspond to database entities.
These models are used for data validation and serialization when interacting
with the database layer, providing a clean interface between the application
logic and data persistence.

The module includes:
- UserInfo: User personal information model
- UserRoles: User authentication and role management model
