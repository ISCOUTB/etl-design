"""Service Schemas Module.

This module defines TypedDict schemas used by service layer components
for file information and metadata handling. These schemas provide type
safety and structure for file-related operations throughout the application.

The schemas are used primarily for file upload validation, content type
detection, and file metadata processing in the service layer.
