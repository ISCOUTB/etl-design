"""RabbitMQ Connection Factory Module.

This module provides a thread-safe RabbitMQ connection factory that manages
connections and channels for each thread, ensuring proper resource management
and thread isolation. The factory pattern allows for efficient resource
sharing while maintaining thread safety.

The factory manages per-thread connections and channels, automatically
creating new ones when needed and providing proper cleanup mechanisms.

Example:
    Using the connection factory:

    >>> from app.messaging.connection_factory import RabbitMQConnectionFactory
    >>>
    >>> # Get a thread-specific channel with context manager
    >>> with RabbitMQConnectionFactory.get_channel() as channel:
    ...     # Use channel for messaging operations
    ...     channel.basic_publish(exchange='test', routing_key='key', body='message')
    >>>
    >>> # Or get connection/channel directly
    >>> connection = RabbitMQConnectionFactory.get_thread_connection()
    >>> channel = RabbitMQConnectionFactory.get_thread_channel()
