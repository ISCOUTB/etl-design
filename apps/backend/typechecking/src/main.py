"""Worker Manager Module.

This module provides a centralized manager for running multiple RabbitMQ workers
in separate threads. The WorkerManager class coordinates the lifecycle of
validation and schema workers, handles graceful shutdown, and manages the
overall worker process.

The manager uses threading to run workers concurrently while maintaining proper
signal handling for clean shutdown operations. It supports both programmatic
control and signal-based termination.

Example:
    Running the worker manager:

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from src.main import WorkerManager
    >>>
    >>> async def run_workers():
    ...     manager = WorkerManager()
    ...     await manager.start_workers()
    >>>
    >>> asyncio.run(run_workers())

    Or run directly:
    >>> python -m src.main
