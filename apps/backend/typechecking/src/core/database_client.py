    """Create a new DatabaseClient instance with retry configuration.

    Returns a configured DatabaseClient with automatic retry on failures,
    exponential backoff, and channel health checking. Each call creates
    a new independent client instance suitable for worker threads.

    Returns:
        DatabaseClient: Configured client with retry logic.

    Configuration:
        - max_retries: 3 attempts before failing
        - retry_delay: 1 second initial delay
        - backoff: 2.0 (exponential: 1s, 2s, 4s)

    Example:
        >>> client = get_database_client()
        >>> response = client.get_task_id(request)
        >>> client.close()  # Clean up when done

    Note:
        For worker threads, create one client per worker to avoid
        sharing gRPC channels across threads. The client is thread-safe
        for its own operations but should not be shared between threads.
