"""RabbitMQ Connection Factory Module.

This module provides a thread-safe RabbitMQ connection factory that manages
connections and channels for each thread, ensuring proper resource management
and thread isolation. The factory pattern allows for efficient resource
sharing while maintaining thread safety.

The factory manages per-thread connections and channels, automatically
creating new ones when needed and providing proper cleanup mechanisms.
