"""
Type definitions for Excel formula AST processing and SQL generation.

This module defines all the TypedDict classes and type aliases used throughout
the DDL generator. It provides comprehensive type definitions for AST nodes,
input data structures, and output mappings to ensure type safety and clear
interfaces between components.

The types are organized into:
- Basic type aliases for AST and reference types
- Input data structures
- Output type definitions for different AST node processing results
- Union types for flexible type handling

class AST(TypedDict):
    """
    Represents an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node.
    Each node can represent a binary expression, a cell range,
    a function call, or a single cell reference in spreadsheet formulas.

    Attributes:
        type (AstTypes): The type of the AST node indicating its structure and purpose.
        operator (Optional[str]): The operator for binary expressions such as "+", "-", "*", "/".
            Only used when type indicates a binary expression.
        left (Optional["AST"]): The left operand for binary expressions, the range start for
            cell ranges, or the first argument for functions. Used for binary expressions,
            functions, and cell ranges.
        right (Optional["AST"]): The right operand for binary expressions, the range end for
            cell ranges, or additional arguments for functions. Used for binary expressions,
            functions, and cell ranges.
        arguments (Optional[list["AST"]]): A list of AST nodes representing the arguments
            passed to function calls. Only used when type indicates a function.
        name (Optional[str]): The name identifier of the function being called, such as
            "SUM", "AVERAGE", "COUNT". Only used for function type nodes.
        refType (Optional[str]): The type of cell reference indicating the range format,
            such as "A1:B2" for ranges or "A1" for single cells. Only used for cell
            reference type nodes.
        key (Optional[str]): The specific cell reference key, such as "A1", "B2", or
            "C3:D5". Only used for cell reference type nodes.
        value (Optional[float]): The numeric value for nodes representing numbers. Only used
            for number type nodes.
